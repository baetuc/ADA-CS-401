    "## Initial research outline\n",
    "\n",
    "As presidents lead their nation, we believe their actions could set an example and influence and encourage certain behaviors. We will investigate if there is a possible correlation between sentiment conveyed by such figures via social media and negative social behavior of a nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presidency of Donald Trump has been marked with many controversies, including the rise of supremacist groups and numerous nation wide conflicts. By using Trump tweets, we would explore if there is a significant temporal correlation between sentiment expressed in the Tweet and the number of conflicts in the nation using GDELT dataset. To reduce the bias of such analysis, we would perform the same analysis with social media activity of his predecessor and compare the results, as well as adding the social-economic aspects which may affect such behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the power of a presidential tweet? We hope that we will have more insight on the answer of this question and raise awareness on the impact 140 characters can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research questions\n",
    "* Do violent events or crimes occur more frequently after presidential tweets?\n",
    "* Is the correlation higher with negative sentiment of the tweet?\n",
    "* Does a significant difference exists between such correlation with Trump and Obama presidency?\n",
    "* Is there a difference in sentiment expressed in tweets before and after Trump becoming a presidential candidate?\n",
    "* How do social-economical aspects influence the correlation?\n",
    "* Does the political regiment affect such negative behavior on a larger scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",

    "#### Trump tweets\n",
    "* Downloading the complete dataset locally and processing the JSON files\n",
    "* We would use mainly the timestamps and tweet content for our analysis:\n",
    "  * timestamps for temporal correlation with events\n",
    "  * tweet content for sentiment analysis\n",
    "* We could follow the impact of tweet by analyzing:\n",
    "  * number of retweets\n",
    "  * number of favorites\n",
    "  * number of followers\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### GDELT\n",
    "* We would use GDELT Global Knowledge graph to gain insights on events:\n",
    "  * geolocalized to USA\n",
    "  * in specified timeframe, starting from 2013\n",
    "  * specific events, such as protests or violent manifestations\n",
    "  * will need knowledge on working on the cluster and accessing the data\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Wikidata\n",
    "* Obtaining data for social-economical indicators:\n",
    "  * for a specific period of time\n",
    "  * for a specific region of the USA\n",
    "  * data wrangling and processing\n",

    "* Internet archive - Trump TV news factchecks: *enrichment dataset*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trump Twitter archive\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump Twitter archive represents the complete collection of Tweets from the account of Donald Trump, since the first Tweet in 2009. The dataset has been obtained from [Trump Twitter Archive github repository](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the dataset has been obtained by combining [Twitter scraper](https://github.com/bpb27/twitter_scraping) and official Twitter API. This combination would allow for scraping Tweets from any user account without a need to use the official premium Twitter API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result set is compliant with Twitter API output and information on meaning of columns in our dataset can be obtained by looking into [official documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/tweet-updates).\n",

    "In further research we would like to have an insight how Donald Trump reacts to the news about him. Obtaining a dataset which collected the news about Donald Trump would be difficult because:\n",
    "* Many sources online - which outlets to select\n",
    "* Possible bias while covering significant portion of news\n",
    "* Duplication of news from different sources\n",
    "* Significant difference in time of publishing\n",
    "* There is a need to extract main topics of news\n",
    "* What is the criteria for marking the news are about Donald Trump - he will appear in many news stories!\n",
    "* No universal API or method for this task - scraping of multiple sites would be necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv?factchecks) has a ready dataset combining televised news clips linked to Donald Trump, from 2009 until today. Most importantly for televised clips - the dates are present, as well as a short list of topics covered. This would make it easier to pinpoint the reaction, if there is any in the Tweets. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Where to process: in cluster or locally?\n",
    "Both **Trump Twitter archive** and **Internet archive - Trump TV news factchecks** are small enough for a local, in-memory processing and analysis. Decisive characteristics of the datasets for a local, in-memory processing are:\n",
