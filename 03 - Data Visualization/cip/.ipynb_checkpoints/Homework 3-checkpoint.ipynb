Think about the colors you use, how you decided to split the intervals into data classes or which interactions you could add in order to make the visualization intuitive and expressive. Compare Switzerland's unemployment rate to that of the rest of Europe.\n",

    "The Swiss Confederation defines the rates you have just plotted as the number of people looking for a job divided by the size of the active population (scaled by 100). This is surely a valid choice, but as we discussed one could argue for a different categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the map you have just created, but this time don't count in your statistics people who already have a job and are looking for a new one. How do your observations change ? You can repeat this with different choices of categories to see how selecting different metrics can lead to different interpretations of the same data.\n",

    "The Economic Secretary (SECO) releases a monthly report on the state of the employment market. In the latest report (September 2017), it is noted that there is a discrepancy between the unemployment rates for foreign (5.1%) and Swiss (2.2%) workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show the difference in unemployment rates between the two categories in each canton on a Choropleth map (hint The easy way is to show two separate maps, but can you think of something better ?). Where are the differences most visible ? Why do you think that is ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's refine the analysis by adding the differences between age groups. As you may have guessed it is nearly impossible to plot so many variables on a map. Make a bar plot, which is a better suited visualization tool for this type of multivariate data.\n",

    "- BONUS: using the map you have just built, and the geographical information contained in it, could you give a rough estimate of the difference in unemployment rates between the areas divided by the Röstigraben?"

    "In the same time, having a lot of information available leads to the situation in which we might get confused and be really unsure what dataset to use. This is the case for the first exercise, where we have the following available branches under Employment and Unemployment domain <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/EN/employ_esms.htm\">[source]</a>:\n",
    "- 'LFS main indicators' consists of a selection of the most important monthly, quarterly and annual  labour market indicators, most of them based on EU-LFS.\n",

    "Looking more carefully at the four branches and the data presented inside, we realize that actually only the first two branches could be helpful in our case. The decision between the two of them might be tough, but we decided to continue with the data in the *LFS main indicators* branch. The main reason for that decision is because in the branch *LFS series - detailed quarterly survey results*, the data presented is the raw data collected every three months from surveys conducted in each country. In the same time, data in the branch *LFS main indicators* is computed from the data in the first branch, but also adjusted and enriched, as presented <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/de/une_esms.htm#stat_pres1496733880223\">here</a>. Therefore, we consider that the data in the first branch is selected more carefully and might be more close to reality than in the second branch.

As we may see <a href=\"http://gisgeography.com/choropleth-maps-data-classification/\">here</a>, one of the best ways of creating classes is the Jenks Natural Breaks. The goal of this method is to construct clusters which have the minimum variations inside, but also the cluster means are at maximum distance.
