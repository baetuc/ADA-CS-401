    "Now, after we have seen the datasets for each country, we are prepared to import all of them in one unified DataFrame. It is important to think about what will be encapsulated in the final table. As we might observe, the difference between the value of <i>total_cum_deaths</i> between two consecutive dates is generally bigger than the number of new deaths between those two dates. Therefore, the reason might be that two consecutive entries are not exactly two consecutive dates or maybe the new deaths are not counted as precise as the cumulative deaths. The same principle is taken into consideration for the new cases and the number of cumulative cases. Therefore, we will take into consideration only the columns <i>total_cum_cases</i> and <i>total_cum_deaths</i>. \n",
