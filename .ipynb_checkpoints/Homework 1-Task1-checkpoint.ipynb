    "Now, after we have seen the datasets for each country, we are prepared to import all of them in one unified DataFrame. It is important to think about what will be encapsulated in the final table. As we might observe, the difference between the value of <i>total_cum_deaths</i> between two consecutive dates is generally bigger than the number of new deaths between those two dates. Therefore, the reason might be that two consecutive entries are not exactly two consecutive dates or maybe the new deaths are not counted as precise as the cumulative deaths. The same principle is taken into consideration for the new cases and the number of cumulative cases. Therefore, we will take into consideration only the columns <i>total_cum_cases</i> and <i>total_cum_deaths</i>. Though, we will also consider the *total_new_cases* and *total_new_deaths* in special cases, such as when we don't have enough information from the other columns for making an average OR when the data is obviously bad for those columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each country, we will compute the daily average per month of new cases and deaths, and then we will unify all of this information. An important observation is that all of the entries are in the year 2014, so we can use a unique month identifier as the month index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average will be computed as follows: for each month in which we have entries, we compute the difference between the value in the last day of the month and the value in the first day of the month, and the difference will be, then, divided by the number of days in the interval. If there is too little information in a month or if it wrong, then we average the values of the *new* columns for all the entries in that month."

    "Calculate the proportion of passengers by *cabin floor*. Present your results in a *pie chart*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we must first determine the number of passengers per cabin floor. This number is not accurate with respect to reality given that not every passenger's data entry contains information about the cabin floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the decks were index by letters {A, B, C, D, E, F, G} https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/.\n",
    "We assume that the first character in the cabin column corresponds to the cabin's deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cases that we take care of:\n",
    ">Passengers with multiple cabins. Solution: we observe that the same multiple-cabins values correspond to multiple passengers. Given that we are interested in number of passengers per floor, we simply add one to the corresponding floor for each of them. The only problem could be that a passenger has cabins on multiple floors. So we check for these cases and find that there are not. Deck F has multiple sections with different identification letters as described lower so we do not consider them multiple floors.\n",
