    "## Initial research outline\n",
    "\n",
    "As presidents lead their nation, we believe their actions could set an example and influence and encourage certain behaviors. We will investigate if there is a possible correlation between sentiment conveyed by such figures via social media and negative social behavior of a nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presidency of Donald Trump has been marked with many controversies, including the rise of supremacist groups and numerous nation wide conflicts. By using Trump tweets, we would explore if there is a significant temporal correlation between sentiment expressed in the Tweet and the number of conflicts in the nation using GDELT dataset. To reduce the bias of such analysis, we would perform the same analysis with social media activity of his predecessor and compare the results, as well as adding the social-economic aspects which may affect such behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the power of a presidential tweet? We hope that we will have more insight on the answer of this question and raise awareness on the impact 140 characters can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research questions\n",
    "* Do violent events or crimes occur more frequently after presidential tweets?\n",
    "* Is the correlation higher with negative sentiment of the tweet?\n",
    "* Does a significant difference exists between such correlation with Trump and Obama presidency?\n",
    "* Is there a difference in sentiment expressed in tweets before and after Trump becoming a presidential candidate?\n",
    "* How do social-economical aspects influence the correlation?\n",
    "* Does the political regiment affect such negative behavior on a larger scale?\n",

    "#### Trump tweets\n",
    "* Downloading the complete dataset locally and processing the JSON files\n",
    "* We would use mainly the timestamps and tweet content for our analysis:\n",

    "  * tweet content for sentiment analysis\n",
    "* We could follow the impact of tweet by analyzing:\n",
    "  * number of retweets\n",
    "  * number of favorites\n",
    "  * number of followers\n",

    "#### GDELT\n",

    "  * geolocalized to USA\n",
    "  * in specified timeframe, starting from 2013\n",
    "  * specific events, such as protests or violent manifestations\n",
    "  * will need knowledge on working on the cluster and accessing the data\n",

    "\n",
    "Internally, the dataset has been obtained by combining [Twitter scraper](https://github.com/bpb27/twitter_scraping) and official Twitter API. This combination would allow for scraping Tweets from any user account without a need to use the official premium Twitter API.\n",

Most importantly for televised clips - the dates are present, as well as a short list of topics covered. This would make it easier to pinpoint the reaction, if there is any in the Tweets. \n",
