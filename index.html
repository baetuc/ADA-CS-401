                The President of the United States is a person with great power and control over the events in the world.
                He is a representative of the state which is one of the major players in world stability: peace, economy, science and developmet among others.

                With great power comes great responsibility, as the president should represent a role model for the nation, while being under constant scrutiny
                of public and media. Donald Trump's Twitter feed represents an unique insight into mindset and opinions of a leader of a nation and a successful businessman.
                Without hesitation and careful diplomatic consideration he is posting his opinions freely. In that freedom we also find inspiration to explore what might
                he reveal about himself and find out more about @realDonaldTrump.

              <p align="justify">
                What we publish on the Web does not disappear. This is a very important consequence for social media and our online presence.
                Even if we seemingly delete an unfortunate image or post, chance is, it is still stored somewhere. This is emphasized to the extremes in cases of
                celebrities and people of power, such as Donald Trump. Here we see a famous gaffe: a late night "covfefe" tweet. He has deleted the Tweet afterwards,
                but it was already too late - everyone was talking about it.
              </p>

              <p align="justify">
                In a similar fashion, Tweets are directly accessible to the public. Our opinions from many years, or a late night rant or drunken post - it is saved somewhere.
                This is only one example of information we leave online: interactions, logs, likes and different metadata is also present to represent our online identity.

                Donald Trump is a businessman, celebrity, media personality and a president. From the emergence of his Twitter account in 2009. he has posted many tweets, but it is

                The majority of the tweets were posted from Android, which is a device of choice for mr. Trump. We can see other utilities,
                such as iPhone or Web Client being prominent as well. Since Donald Trump has been noted to
                <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/01/trump-doesnt-trust-computers/">rarely use computers</a>
                we can for now assume the posts he made are originating from Android. That is a significant amount of Tweets that are approved,
                but not directly penned by Donald Trump.

                This is visible from the Twitter data as well: the last Tweet posted from Android is on <b>25th of March, 2017</b>, keeping his promise of using a more secure device.
                Seeing that iPhone has been used before as well in parallel, it could be either his social media maganers or himself.

                on June 16th, 2015, his Twitter account has seen a steady increase in interactions - signs of undergoing campaign and supporters flowing in.

                Comparing the devices used to post: Android and iPhone, we can observe slight differences.
                If we consider Trump using his Android phone until March (when there is a halt from that device), iPhone has been used
                presumably by his social media and campaing managers to promote him as a candidate.
                <br />
                <br />
                In general more popular tweets have come from Donald Trump himself, notable popular examples suggest presidential victory.
                and inauguration as important events, besides other peaks that can be observed.
                After March 2017, it is more difficult to track the author
                solely by relying on the presumption of the device used.

              <h2 id="fake" style="margin-top:20px;">Fake news?</h2>
              <p align="justify">
                <i>Fake news</i> has become an infamous term used by Donald Trump frequently to discard news and lable media outlets as "fake".
                These reactions are usually to news coverage that is not benevolent towards policies and critique his stances and appriaches.
                We can notice that "fake news" has emerged since end of 2016 - just about when he was to take the office as POTUS.
                The frequency has been relatively spread out, with certain significant mentions from the news appearing on the days with most frequent "fake news" tweets:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    September 30th 2017 - criticism on Puerto Rican hurricane response and Alabama preliminaries.

                From this naive approach, we can pair up the news from 1 and 5 day intervals - to try to filter out the regular news
                that might not be targeted by his tweets. With this approach no formal conclusions can be made.
                Another "intuitive" but thus possibly wrong conclusion might be that unmatched long term topics are actually targeted
                by such tweets, in this case: Ethics, Military, Climate Change, Foreign Policy and Environment.
                <br /><br />
                We do not have the expertise to test the hypothesis in such settings (news and social sciences). One of the presumptions
                and hypotheses could be that he is using "fake news" to diminish the effect of certain topics and media outlets by targeting
                them on purpose. However, we did not test this hypothesis yet.

                Without certainty and formal testing, we presume that such behavior might be about deflecting and diminishing certain topics,

                We can observe that after significant number of news topics with Russia, CNN or MAGA is mentioned.
                Our presumption is that these responses might be to discredit the news outlets, while enforcing high level of patriotism
                in contrast to Russian implications - in order to diminish the importance of the news.
                <br /><br />
                More apparently with FBI news topic, there is a sudden spike in CNN and DRUDGE_REPORT mentions, showing that Trump reacts
                directly by referencing right-wing news aggregation website along with CNN.

                <br /><br />
                In order to make direct conclusions, we would have to consult pshycologicsts, news analysts, politicologists and experts in
                social media and social sciences to provide a definite conclusion. Based on the data, we show the peculiarities we have observed, along
                with our presumptions. It is an insight - not a ground truth or hypothesis.
