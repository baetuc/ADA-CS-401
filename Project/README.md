# Trump - a 140 character insight

## Abstract

### Initial concept
As presidents lead their nation, we believe their actions could set an example and influence and encourage certain behaviors. We will investigate if there is a possible correlation between sentiment conveyed by such figures via social media and negative social behavior of a nation.

The presidency of Donald Trump has been marked with many controversies, including the rise of supremacist groups and numerous nation wide conflicts. By using Trump tweets, we would explore if there is a significant temporal correlation between sentiment expressed in the Tweet and the number of conflicts in the nation using GDELT dataset. To reduce the bias of such analysis, we would perform the same analysis with social media activity of his predecessor and compare the results, as well as adding the social-economic aspects which may affect such behaviors.

What is the power of a presidential tweet? We hope that we will have more insight on the answer of this question and raise awareness on the impact 140 characters can make.

### Topic evolution
Modelling of social behavior of a nation would require significant time and expertise to reach conclusions with high level of confidence. Moreover, finding a significant change due to social media influence would be even harder to prove. Additionally, GDELT does not provide the specificity and granularity envisioned for this task.

Therefore, we adapted the scope of the research, continuing on the topic of insights Tweets could provide.

## Research questions
* ~~Do violent events or crimes occur more frequently after presidential tweets?~~
* ~~Is the correlation higher with negative sentiment of the tweet?~~
* ~~Does a significant difference exists between such correlation with Trump and Obama presidency?~~
* ~~How do social-economical aspects influence the correlation?~~
* ~~Does the political regiment affect such negative behavior on a larger scale?~~
* Is there a difference in sentiment expressed in tweets before and after Trump becoming a presidential candidate?
    * How does the sentiment evolve in Tweets? What are the predominant emotions?
* What is the structure of popular Tweets? Whom does he mention or tag?
* Is there a significant trend in Trump reacting to certain topics in news?
    * What does he tweet about after certain topic in news is published?
    * Does he try to distract his followers by certain topics (e.g. after topics such as Russia)

## Dataset

### Trump tweets
* We have performed an exploratory data analysis - more details about the dataset in the notebook
### Internet archive - Trump TV news factchecks
* Used for enriching the dataset - answering the final research question - more details in the notebook

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 3
* Finalizing the data analysis
* Further exploring options for Natural Language Processing
* Different approaches in tweet analysis:
    * using different subset of features (device, time of day, public engagement, tags)
* Improving methodology to make sure results have a high level of confidence

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Learning how to process big data with frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark
* Getting to know the datasets in finer detail
* Discussing possible factors which may bias our conclusions
* Tweets wrangling and analysis

## Remarks for the TA team
We are thankful for insights provided by the professor and the TA team who have helped make our project feasable in scope.
