    "## Initial research outline\n",
    "\n",
    "As presidents lead their nation, we believe their actions could set an example and influence and encourage certain behaviors. We will investigate if there is a possible correlation between sentiment conveyed by such figures via social media and negative social behavior of a nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presidency of Donald Trump has been marked with many controversies, including the rise of supremacist groups and numerous nation wide conflicts. By using Trump tweets, we would explore if there is a significant temporal correlation between sentiment expressed in the Tweet and the number of conflicts in the nation using GDELT dataset. To reduce the bias of such analysis, we would perform the same analysis with social media activity of his predecessor and compare the results, as well as adding the social-economic aspects which may affect such behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the power of a presidential tweet? We hope that we will have more insight on the answer of this question and raise awareness on the impact 140 characters can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research questions\n",
    "* Do violent events or crimes occur more frequently after presidential tweets?\n",
    "* Is the correlation higher with negative sentiment of the tweet?\n",
    "* Does a significant difference exists between such correlation with Trump and Obama presidency?\n",
    "* Is there a difference in sentiment expressed in tweets before and after Trump becoming a presidential candidate?\n",
    "* How do social-economical aspects influence the correlation?\n",
    "* Does the political regiment affect such negative behavior on a larger scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trump tweets\n",
    "* Downloading the complete dataset locally and processing the JSON files\n",
    "* We would use mainly the timestamps and tweet content for our analysis:\n",

    "  * tweet content for sentiment analysis\n",
    "* We could follow the impact of tweet by analyzing:\n",
    "  * number of retweets\n",
    "  * number of favorites\n",
    "  * number of followers\n",

    "#### GDELT\n",

    "  * geolocalized to USA\n",
    "  * in specified timeframe, starting from 2013\n",
    "  * specific events, such as protests or violent manifestations\n",
    "  * will need knowledge on working on the cluster and accessing the data\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Wikidata\n",
    "* Obtaining data for social-economical indicators:\n",
    "  * for a specific period of time\n",
    "  * for a specific region of the USA\n",
    "  * data wrangling and processing\n",

    "Even though we were passionate about our idea, we have realized we need to reduce the scope and pinpoint specific research questions that are feasible with our current expertise and available time. We are thankful to very insightful comments from professor Bob West who steered us to our current project. The project is reasonable, it is possibly insightful and we hope to squeeze as much information from the dataset as possible.\n",

One option would be to extract the location details from the coordinates, and then extract the required infomation (e.g. country name). This is possible by utilizing [`geopy` package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy), more specifically [`Nominatim`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim), which represents a Python wrapper of the Nominatium API. We will showcase the example of extracting the country names from the previously visualized markers."

As news topic evolve and his tweets support agenda which is not necessarily covered in the news, there will be a noise in data we cannot discard. Thus, we did not provide a statistical hypothesis that we wanted to prove, but a data exploration and observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe the emergence of certain topics and their increase in frequency and speed of decay of topic, as shown for \"Fake news\", \"Obama\" or \"Hillary Clinton\".

    "\n",
    "### When certain topic is in news, what does Trump tweet about?\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal is more clear, albeit statistically unproved. Trump will not tweet about certain topics only when some news appear (as that would be rather transparent and foolish). \n",
    "We can observe, however, the trend more clearly - when certain topics are in the news, he will have a more direct and evident response through mentions and hashtags. Obviously, he does not target all the published news since that may diminish the strength of his rhetoric. We could however extract the news with strong signal and analyze their content, but that falls out of scope of this project and our expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This coincided for cases of Russia and FBI cases where CNN has been intensively mentioned when news would be published (fake news) and Drudge report as a right-wing news outlet, as well as MAGA frequency (to enforce the patriotism). A more detailed survey would have to be done to statistically prove these claims as significant. But for now, we show a pattern we have observed by digging into data.\n",

It should thus be possible to extend these functions to any tweet content to obtain news, and vice versa, with the news. A future possibility would be a system which would allow flexible searches and analysis, such as web application.\n",

As presented [in this link](http://t-redactyl.io/blog/2017/04/using-vader-to-handle-sentiment-analysis-with-social-media-text.html), VADER assigns a sentiment score for each word, realized using crowd-sourcing on *Amazon Mechanical Turk*. In a nutshell, VADER looks not only at scores for words, but also at capitalisation of letters and expressions such as **extremely** bad, which should increase the negativity of the score, in this case. Also, this is one of the main reasons we decided to keep text exactly as it was initially and not change letters to lower. More information could be found in the initial [paper](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf). \n",
