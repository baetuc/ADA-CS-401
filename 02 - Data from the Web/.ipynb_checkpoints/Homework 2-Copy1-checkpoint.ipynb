    "1. Obtain the 200 top-ranking universities in www.topuniversities.com ([ranking 2018](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2018)). In particular, extract the following fields for each university: name, rank, country and region, number of faculty members (international and total) and number of students (international and total). Some information is not available in the main list and you have to find them in the [details page](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/ecole-polytechnique-fédérale-de-lausanne-epfl).\n",
    "Store the resulting dataset in a pandas DataFrame and answer the following questions:\n",
    "- Which are the best universities in term of: (a) ratio between faculty members and students, (b) ratio of international students?\n",
    "- Answer the previous question aggregating the data by (c) country and (d) region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot your data using bar charts and describe briefly what you observed.\n",

    "2. Obtain the 200 top-ranking universities in www.timeshighereducation.com ([ranking 2018](http://timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking)). Repeat the analysis of the previous point and discuss briefly what you observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Merge the two DataFrames created in questions 1 and 2 using university names. Match universities' names as well as you can, and explain your strategy. Keep track of the original position in both rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find useful insights in the data by performing an exploratory analysis. Can you find a strong correlation between any pair of variables in the dataset you just created? Example: when a university is strong in its international dimension, can you observe a consistency both for students and faculty members?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Can you find the best university taking in consideration both rankings? Explain your approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- Keep your Notebook clean and don't print the verbose output of the requests if this does not add useful information for the reader.\n",
    "- In case of tie, use the order defined in the webpage.\n"

    "Scores are variables in range from 0.0 to 100.0, floating point value. They are derived from the parameters collected, surveys conducted and described in more detail in the provided [methodology](https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings/methodology). As prior described they would not be imputed if missing since the error induced in this case, as well as the value of such variable would be low."

    "\n",
    "We can see that the New York University (NYU) has information that is completely missing, while Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore has one missing raw value. Considering the scope of missing values, they will be manually set using the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NYU: https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/nyu-at-a-glance.html, https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/nyu-facts.html\n",
    "- IISc: http://www.iisc.ac.in/iisc-in-numbers/#ffs-tabbed-12\n",
    "\n",
    "This is potentially troubling, since there is no information about the actual data collection for the ranking, methodology or actual date which is available for a confident selection of the figures missing. Frequently, the websites also omit the precise dates. Comparing the potential noise which would be added to the fact that we would discard 2 top 200 universities, the decision is to take the data and impute it, while being aware that it might induce some error in methodology. It is a tradeoff between statistical error in imputed data and the error which would occur in the further aggregate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the NYU data is following:\n",
    "- total faculty members: 7861 (Fall 2015)\n",
    "- total students: 58419 (Fall 2015)\n",
    "- international faculty members: 619 (September 2017)\n",
    "- international students: 26% == 15189 (Fall 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the data of international faculty members is not available in public records online for IISc, therefore it will be designated as 0. The unavailability might rise from the fact that the figure is [rather low](https://scroll.in/article/811696/there-are-no-indian-universities-in-the-worlds-top-250-list-heres-how-javadekar-can-change-that), so it would not be positive for faculty to publicize such information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we try to follow the rule not to completely penalize omission of data if possible, as described in [THE methodology](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/methodology-world-university-rankings-2016-2017):\n",
    "> *On the rare occasions when a particular data point is not provided we enter a low estimate between the average value of the indicators and the lowest value reported: the 25th percentile of the other indicators. By doing this, we avoid penalising an institution too harshly with a “zero” value for data that it overlooks or does not provide, but we do not reward it for withholding them.*\n",

For that, we first need to understand better our data. As we observed, we have multiple universities names followed by their acronyms in the TU dataset. Let's analyze in a more in-dept manner those cases:"

    "It can be seen that, besides one name, all the ones that contain a parantheses keep the acronym of the university appended to the name. It is not the case of UCL, where in fact the full name is in parantheses, while the acronym is outside. We will have to handle this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, one really important thing to notice is that some universities have their name stated in the native language in one ranking, while in the other one is in English. This is the case, for example, of **Technical University of Berlin**, as named in the THE tanking, which in is named **Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)** in the TU ranking. Therefore, one more thing we should handle should be language differences. The solution for that would be to translate every university name in English language, using an API which makes requests to Google Translate servers. In that manner, all names will be expressed in the same language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that some names have some additional not-so-meaningful words in their structure, as *of* or *the*. An example of this is **The university of Hong Kong**, as per TU ranking, and **University of Hong Kong**, as expressed in THE ranking. This problem will be solved by eliminating the unncecessary words and punctuation signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last issue concerned is the words order. We might have universities that appear in both rankings, but with different order of words, or even the different order might be injected by the previous translation. We solve the problem by representing the normalized name as a set of words, so that the order of the words don't matter when similarity is established.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the solution for normalizing names is as follows: for **UCL**, transform the name into **University College London**, to keep consistency in the dataset. Then, get rid of the acronym when exists, transform name to lower case and replace punctation marks in name. After that, translate name in English, get rid of the linking words and then split the name into words. Finally, the representation will be consisting of the set of all words resulted from the last operation. The implementation is presented below:"
