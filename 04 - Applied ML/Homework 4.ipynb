Such populations might have a chance to get only the jobs with the lowest salaries. Thus programs intended for such populations should not be funded since we have proven they do not benefit the population and they are just a hole in the budget.\n",

Actually,\\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\\nregular season game.

Given that the parameters to tune are already chosen, one important decision that is left to be made here is the range of the parameters. For this process we will have an iterative approach in which we will start with some coarse values and after each iteration we will fine-graine our intervals.\n",

    "Another decision with high importance is the evaluation function to be used when tuning our hyperparameters. Given that the data is reasonably distributed across the classes we will use the simple accuracy metric for evaluation. The accuracy metric returns the fraction of matching labels between the predicted labels and actual labels. In other words, it counts the fraction of data entries we classified correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to tune our parameters we will use the sklearn function GridSearchCV.\n",
    "We pass it a dictionary with parameters values containing an array of values for each parameter and it will iterate over all combinations of these values. It will do, by default, a 3-fold cross-validation to evaluate the current combination.\n",
    "Given that our estimator is a classifier (RandomForestClassifier) the cross-validation will be a stratified-3-fold cross validation.\n",
    "Additionally, we will specify the scoring method to be the above mentioned accuracy metric and we will parallelize the training over 4 thread using n_jobs parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing to be mentioned is that GridSearchCV will return the best classifier trained on the entire dataset"

Another example that our classifier manages to select proper keywords from the docs is the high importance our classifier give to the word **god** as it is reasonably to assume that this words is more specific to subjects **alt.atheism** or **soc.religion.christian** than, say, **comp.graphics** which makes it a good feature to differentiate upon."
